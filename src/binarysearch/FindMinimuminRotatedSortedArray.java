/*
 * You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending
 * order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array
 * nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:
 * 
 * [3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times. [1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6
 * times. Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of
 * the array to the beginning. Rotating the array 6 times produces the original
 * array.
 * 
 * Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the
 * minimum element of this array.
 * 
 * A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that
 * runs in O(log n) time?
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2]
 * 
 * Output: 1 Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,5,0,1,2,3]
 * 
 * Output: 0 Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7]
 * 
 * Output: 4
